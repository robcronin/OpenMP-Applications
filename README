Based on assignment in HPC module for MSc in HPC
Some basic applications of using openMP
	- Gauss Eliminiation
	- Sieve of Eratosthenes


Note: This was developed early in the course and may be a bit rough around the edges
	e.g. It has not been properly seperated into header files etc



To compile:
	make

To run:
	make gauss-test
	make sieve-test
	./gauss.out [-n int]
	./sieve.out [-n int]

To graph:
	make graph		- About 1-2 minutes
